    "## 695. Max Area of Island\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",
    "Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.\n",
