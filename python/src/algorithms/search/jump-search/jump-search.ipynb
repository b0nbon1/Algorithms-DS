    "### Jump Search\n",
    "Like [Binary Search](../binary-search), Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements (than [linear search](../linear-search)) by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) size m. Then we search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m]…..arr[km] and so on. Once we find the interval (arr[km] < x < arr[(k+1)m]), we perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider the following array: (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610). Length of the array is 16. Jump search will find the value of 55 with the following steps assuming that the block size to be jumped is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "STEP 1: Jump from index 0 to index 4; \n",
    "STEP 2: Jump from index 4 to index 8; \n",
    "STEP 3: Jump from index 8 to index 12; \n",
    "STEP 4: Since the element at index 12 is greater than 55 we will jump back a step to come to index 8. \n",
    "STEP 5: Perform linear search from index 8 to get the element 55.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the optimal block size to be skipped? \n",
    "In the worst case, we have to do n/m jumps and if the last checked value is greater than the element to be searched for, we perform m-1 comparisons more for linear search. Therefore the total number of comparisons in the worst case will be ((n/m) + m-1). The value of the function ((n/m) + m-1) will be minimum when m = √n. Therefore, the best step size is m = √n.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity : O(√n) \n",
    "- Auxiliary Space : O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points: \n",
    " \n",
    "- Works only sorted arrays.\n",
    "- The optimal size of a block to be jumped is (√ n). This makes the time complexity of Jump Search O(√ n).\n",
    "- The time complexity of Jump Search is between Linear Search ( ( O(n) ) and Binary Search ( O (Log n) ).\n",
    "- Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump search has an advantage that we traverse back only once (Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps, consider a situation where the element to be searched is the smallest element or just bigger than the smallest). So in a system where binary search is costly, we use Jump Search."
