    "### Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store \"items\" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of binary search: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary search tree of size 9 and depth 3, with 8 at the root. The leaves are not drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    " ![Binary tree 1](BSTSearch.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "The above properties of Binary Search Tree provides an ordering among keys so that the operations like search, minimum and maximum can be done fast. If there is no ordering, then we may have to compare every key to search for a given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Searching a Key\n",
    "\n",
    "For searching a value, if we had a sorted array we could have performed a binary search. Let’s say we want to search a number in the array, in binary search, we first define the complete list as our search space, the number can exist only within the search space. Now we compare the number to be searched or the element to be searched with the middle element (median) of the search space and if the record being searched is less than the middle element, we go searching in the left half, else we go searching in the right half, in case of equality we have found the element. In binary search we start with ‘n’ elements in search space and if the mid element is not the element that we are looking for, we reduce the search space to ‘n/2’ we keep reducing the search space until we either find the record that we are looking for or we get to only one element in search space and be done with this whole reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Search operations in binary search tree will be very similar. Let’s say we want to search for the number, we start at the root, and then we compare the value to be searched with the value of the root, if it’s equal we are done with the search if it’s smaller we know that we need to go to the left subtree because in a binary search tree all the elements in the left subtree are smaller and all the elements in the right subtree are larger. Searching an element in the binary search tree is basically this traversal, at each step we go either left or right and at each step we discard one of the sub-trees. If the tree is balanced (we call a tree balanced if for all nodes the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees is not greater than one) we start with a search space of ‘n’ nodes and as we discard one of the sub-trees, we discard ‘n/2’ nodes so our search space gets reduced to ‘n/2’. In the next step we reduce the search space to ‘n/4’ and we repeat until we find the element or our search space is reduced to only one node. The search here is also a binary search hence the name; Binary Search Tree."
