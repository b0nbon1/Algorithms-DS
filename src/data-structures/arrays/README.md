## Arrays

### What is a Static array?

A static array is a fixed length container containing `n` elements **indexable** from the range `[0, n-1]`.

- **indexable** means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number.

### Uses of arrays

1. Storing and accessing sequential data.
2. Temporarily storing objects
3. Used by IO routines as buffers
4. Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables.
5. Can be used to return multiple values from a function.
6. Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems.
