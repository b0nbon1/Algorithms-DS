    "## Priority Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority Queue is an abstract data type, which is similar to a queue, however, in the priority queue, every element has some priority. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue. Therefore all the elements are either arranged in an ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Every item has a priority associated with it.\n",
    "- An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.\n",
    "- If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below priority queue, an element with a maximum ASCII value will have the highest priority. The elements with higher priority are served first. \n",
    "\n",
    "![priority Queue](./Priority-Queue-min-1024x512.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A typical priority queue supports the following operations:\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** When a new element is inserted in a priority queue, it moves to the empty slot from top to bottom and left to right. However, if the element is not in the correct place then it will be compared with the parent node. If the element is not in the correct order, the elements are swapped. The swapping process continues until all the elements are placed in the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:**  As you know that in a max heap, the maximum element is the root node. And it will remove the element which has maximum priority first. Thus, you remove the root node from the queue. This removal creates an empty slot, which will be further filled with new insertion. Then, it compares the newly inserted element with all the elements inside the queue to maintain the heap invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Peek:** This operation helps to return the maximum element from Max Heap or minimum element from Min Heap without deleting the node from the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Priority Queue:\n",
    "1. **Ascending Order:** As the name suggests, in ascending order priority queue, the element with a lower priority value is given a higher priority in the priority list. For example, if we have the following elements in a priority queue arranged in ascending order like 4,6,8,9,10. Here, 4 is the smallest number, therefore, it will get the highest priority in a priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Descending order:** The root node is the maximum element in a max heap, as you may know. It will also remove the element with the highest priority first. As a result, the root node is removed from the queue. This deletion leaves an empty space, which will be filled with fresh insertions in the future. The heap invariant is then maintained by comparing the newly inserted element to all other entries in the queue.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. It is a `Complete Tree`. This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Binary Heap is either `Min Heap` or `Max Heap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a `Min Binary Heap`, the key at the root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.\n",

    "- **getMax():** Returns an element with maximum priority.\n",

    "- Suppose below is the given Binary Heap that follows all the properties of Binary Max Heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "![binary heap example 1](./exa1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now a node with value 32 need to be insert in the above heap: To insert an element, attach the new element to any leaf. For Example A node with priority 32 can be added to the leaf of the node 11. But this violates the heap property. To maintain the heap property, shift up the new node 32. \n",
    "\n",
    "![binary heap example 2](./ex2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shift Up Operation get node with 32 at the correct position: Swap the incorrectly placed node with its parent until the heap property is satisfied. For Example: As node 11 is less than node 32 so, swap node 11 and node 32. Then, swap node 14 and node 32. And at last, swap node 31 and node 32. \n",
    "\n",
    "![binary heap example 3](./ex3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ExtractMax:** The maximum value is stored at the root of the tree. But the root of the tree cannot be directly removed. First, it is replaced with any one of the leaves and then removed. For Example: To remove Node 45, it is first replaced with node 11. But this violates the heap property, so move the replaced node down. For that, use shift down operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![binary heap example 4](./ex4.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ShiftDown operation:** Swap the incorrectly placed node with a larger child until the heap property is satisfied. For Example: Node 11 is swapped with node 32 then, with node 31 and in last it is swapped with node 14. \n",
    "\n",
    "![binary heap example 5](./ex5.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ChangePriority:** Let the changed element shift up or down depending on whether its priority decreased or increased. For Example: Change the priority of nodes 11 to 35, due to this change the node has to shift up the node in order to maintain the heap property.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove:** To remove an element, change its priority to a value larger than the current maximum, then shift it up, and then extract it using extract max. Find the current maximum using getMax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GetMax:** The max value is stored at the root of the tree. To getmax, just return the value at the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Representation of Binary Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the heap is maintained in form of a `complete binary tree`, because of this fact the heap can be represented in the form of an array. To keep the tree complete and shallow, while inserting a new element insert it in the leftmost vacant position in the last level i.e., at the end of our array. Similarly, while extracting maximum replace the root with the last leaf at the last level i.e., the last element of the array. Below is the illustration of the same: \n",
