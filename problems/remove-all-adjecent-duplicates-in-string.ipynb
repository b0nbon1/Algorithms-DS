    "## 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"abcd\", k = 2\n",
    "Output: \"abcd\"\n",
    "Explanation: There's nothing to delete.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"deeedbbcccbdaa\", k = 3\n",
    "Output: \"aa\"\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "First delete \"eee\" and \"ccc\", get \"ddbbbdaa\"\n",
    "Then delete \"bbb\", get \"dddaa\"\n",
    "Finally delete \"ddd\", get \"aa\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"pbbcggttciiippooaais\", k = 2\n",
    "Output: \"ps\"\n",
    "```"
