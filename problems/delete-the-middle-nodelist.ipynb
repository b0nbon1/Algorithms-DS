    "## 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.\n",
    "\n",
    "For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "![delegtmiddle node](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/16/eg1drawio.png)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]\n",
    "Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.\n",
    "Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.\n",
    "We return the new list after removing this node. \n",
    "```\n"
